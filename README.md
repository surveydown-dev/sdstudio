## sdstudio

**sdstudio** is a companion package that support the
[surveydown](https://surveydown.org/) survey platform. It launches a
Shiny webapp and transforms the typical code-heavy survey creation
workflow into an accessible Graphical User Interface, making it easy to
create, preview, and manage surveys without extensive programming
knowledge.

## Installation

The **sdstudio** package is not yet on CRAN, but the development version
can be installed from GitHub:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("surveydown-dev/sdstudio", ask = FALSE)
```

## Launch the Studio

The **surveydown Studio** is the main application in **sdstudio** - a
unified Shiny interface for complete survey lifecycle management. Launch
it with:

``` r
sdstudio::launch()
```

  - Specialized surveys (Conjoint experiments, Interactive maps, Live
    polling)
- **Dual-pane editor** with visual builder and code editor (ACE
  integration)
- **12 question types** including multiple choice, text, numeric,
  sliders, dates
- **Real-time synchronization** between visual interface and underlying
  code

**Responsive Design**: Built with Bootstrap 5, providing a modern,
mobile-friendly interface that works across all devices.

**Development Workflow**: Switch between Local (development) and Live
(production) modes with one click, supporting iterative survey
development and testing.

## Database Configuration

The studio supports flexible database connection modes:

``` r
# Auto mode (recommended) - tries GSSAPI first, falls back if needed
launch()

# Prefer mode - uses GSSAPI if available, plain connection if not  
launch(gssencmode = "prefer")

# Disable mode - forces plain connection (useful for VPN environments)
launch(gssencmode = "disable")
```

Configure your database connection using environment variables or the
built-in Settings interface within the studio.
