## sdstudio

**sdstudio** is a companion package for building, previewing, and managing surveys built using the [surveydown](https://surveydown.org/) survey platform through a Graphical User Interface (GUI). The studio runs as a local Shiny web app and makes it easier to create, preview, and manage surveys without extensive programming knowledge.

## Installation

The **sdstudio** package is not yet on CRAN, but the development version can be installed from GitHub:

```{r}
#| eval: false

# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("surveydown-dev/sdstudio", ask = FALSE)
```

## Launch the Studio

The **surveydown studio** is the main application in **sdstudio**. Launch it with:

```{r}
#| eval: false

sdstudio::launch()
```

## Database Configuration

The studio supports flexible database connection modes:

```{r}
#| eval: false

# Auto mode (recommended) - tries GSSAPI first, falls back if needed
launch()

# Prefer mode - uses GSSAPI if available, plain connection if not  
launch(gssencmode = "prefer")

# Disable mode - forces plain connection (useful for VPN environments)
launch(gssencmode = "disable")
```

Configure your database connection using environment variables or the built-in Settings interface within the studio.
