# Summary

Survey research is fundamental to social sciences, market research, and data collection across numerous disciplines. While code-based survey platforms like `surveydown` [@surveydown2025] offer powerful capabilities for reproducible research, researchers often benefit from complementary tools that enhance workflow efficiency. `sdstudio` is an R package that provides a comprehensive graphical user interface (GUI) companion for the `surveydown` platform, offering multiple interaction modes to suit different preferences and use cases. Built using the Shiny framework [@shiny2021], `sdstudio` features three main components: a visual survey builder with real-time code synchronization (the "Build" tab), an interactive preview system supporting both desktop and mobile views (the "Preview" tab), and a data management interface for response collection and analysis (the "Responses" tab). A comprehensive tutorial and demonstration is available [@sdstudio_tutorial2025].

# Statement of need

The `surveydown` platform has established itself as a powerful framework for creating reproducible, code-based surveys [@surveydown2025]. However, survey research workflows can benefit from enhanced tools that complement programmatic approaches. Three key areas present opportunities for improved efficiency: (1) visual survey construction for users who prefer graphical interfaces, (2) immediate live preview capabilities during development, and (3) convenient database access for response management.

While code-based survey development offers unparalleled control and reproducibility [@dillman2014internet], different researchers have varying workflow preferences and requirements. Some prefer visual drag-and-drop interfaces for rapid prototyping, others need immediate feedback during survey development, and many require streamlined access to response data without complex database queries [@groves2009survey].

`sdstudio` addresses these diverse needs by providing a comprehensive companion interface that enhances the `surveydown` ecosystem. The package offers three specialized components: a Build tab with visual survey construction tools, a Preview tab for real-time survey testing, and a Responses tab for database management. Importantly, the Responses tab serves all `surveydown` users regardless of their preference for GUI or code-based development, providing a unified interface for response data access and analysis [@tourangeau2017adaptive].

The package supports complex survey features including conditional logic, randomization, custom question types, and integration with PostgreSQL databases for secure data storage. By generating and maintaining the underlying `surveydown` code automatically, `sdstudio` ensures that surveys remain reproducible and can be further customized by technical team members when needed.

# Implementation

`sdstudio` is built using the R Shiny framework and leverages several key architectural components. The package employs a reactive programming model that enables real-time synchronization between the visual structure editor and the underlying `surveydown` code. The drag-and-drop interface is implemented using custom JavaScript handlers that communicate with R through Shiny's reactive system, allowing users to manipulate survey elements visually while maintaining code integrity.

The core interface features a dual-pane design (\autoref{fig:interface}): the left "Structure" panel provides hierarchical page and content management with drag-and-drop functionality, while the right "Code" panel displays the automatically generated `surveydown` markup using the ACE code editor. Database connectivity is handled through the DBI and RPostgres packages, with support for connection pooling and GSSAPI encryption for enterprise security requirements.

The template system uses existing templates supported in the `surveydown-dev` GitHub repositories. Response data validation is handled through `surveydown`'s built-in mechanisms, while the database integration supports both local development with CSV files and production deployment with PostgreSQL databases. The package automatically generates survey metadata and maintains session state across the three-tab interface, ensuring seamless transitions between design, preview, and data management workflows. Security features include environment variable management for database credentials and automatic `.gitignore` generation to prevent accidental exposure of sensitive configuration files.

# Comparison with Existing Tools

Unlike proprietary platforms such as Qualtrics or SurveyMonkey, `sdstudio` maintains full data ownership and integrates seamlessly with R statistical workflows. Compared to other open-source solutions like LimeSurvey [@limesurvey2012] or formr [@arslan2019formr], `sdstudio` uniquely combines visual design capabilities with programmatic reproducibility through its tight integration with the `surveydown` ecosystem. While LimeSurvey offers extensive survey creation features, it operates as a standalone web application without direct integration to statistical analysis environments. Similarly, formr provides excellent R integration for complex longitudinal studies but focuses primarily on experience-sampling rather than general survey design. The real-time code synchronization feature distinguishes `sdstudio` from traditional form builders, ensuring that visual changes are immediately reflected in version-controllable markdown files while preserving the full analytical capabilities of the R ecosystem.

# Usage and Target Applications

`sdstudio` serves diverse research contexts, from academic social science studies requiring complex experimental designs to market research projects needing rapid prototype iteration. The dual-pane interface accommodates both experienced R users who prefer code visibility and newcomers who benefit from visual feedback during survey development. Educational institutions use the platform for teaching survey methodology, allowing students to learn both visual design principles and underlying code structure simultaneously. Research teams leverage the collaborative features for multi-investigator projects, where team members with different technical backgrounds can contribute effectively to survey development. The database management capabilities particularly benefit longitudinal studies and large-scale data collection efforts where response monitoring and real-time data access are essential for research operations.

# Acknowledgements

We acknowledge the broader `surveydown` community for valuable feedback and testing during development. Special thanks to early adopters who provided insights into workflow requirements and user interface design. This work builds upon the foundation provided by the R and Shiny ecosystems, particularly the contributions of the RStudio team to reactive web application development. We also recognize the open-source survey research community, whose prior work on platforms like LimeSurvey and formr informed our understanding of researcher needs and technical requirements.
